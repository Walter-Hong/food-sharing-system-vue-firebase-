The aim of our project is to create a food sharing web application based on Vue framework, Firebase mobile development platform.

This intends to connect people who live in the same location and nearby shops so that any surplus food that is not needed, is shared between the users, instead of being thrown away.

How to run the project?

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
